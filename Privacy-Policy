We don't store any of your information, period. 
WHY WE DON'T COLLECT YOUR DATA:
  It is simply not necessary for this apps function. 
  This app does not require any personal information and doesn't rely on saved data. 
  When you restart the app, it will appear new as if it was just installed. 
  Just as with a calculator, Traders Tool requires no knowledge of previous uses. 
  We simply don't believe in the storage and/or use of unnecessary data and none is necessary. 
There are no third party services involved so no one stores your information at all. 
Due to it's simplistic nature, no services are required for payment processing, data transfer or any number of other tasks. 
Because of this, you are not at risk of having data shared with anyone.
